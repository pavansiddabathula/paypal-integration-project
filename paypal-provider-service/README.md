# PayPal Provider Service

This microservice is responsible for integrating PayPal Standard Checkout into our overall payment system. It acts as a Payment Service Provider (PSP) module and handles all core PayPal-related operations such as order creation, capturing payments, and retrieving order status.

---

## üìå Features

- Integration with PayPal Standard Checkout
- Implements key PayPal REST APIs:
  - `createOrder`
  - `getOrder`
  - `captureOrder`
- OAuth 2.0-based authentication
- Redis caching for token management
- Designed for scale, reliability, and fault tolerance

---

## üîÅ Standard Checkout Flow

1. **Customer initiates a purchase** on the e-commerce platform.
2. The platform triggers the `createOrder` API to initiate a PayPal transaction.
3. PayPal presents a hosted checkout page to the customer.
4. The customer logs in and authorizes payment.
5. The platform can fetch payment status using the `getOrder` API.
6. Once authorized, the `captureOrder` API is triggered to finalize and deduct the payment.
7. Payment is settled to the merchant account after deducting PayPal fees.

## üîê OAuth 2.0 Authentication

- We authenticate using PayPal‚Äôs OAuth 2.0 token endpoint.
- The access token is valid for 8 hours.
- We cache the token in Redis with a TTL of **7 hours 30 minutes**.
- Once expired, the system automatically re-fetches and stores a new token.
- This ensures seamless, uninterrupted access to PayPal APIs.
