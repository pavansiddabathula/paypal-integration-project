# üßæ PayPal Processing Service

The `paypal-processing-service` is a core microservice in our payment infrastructure. It ensures accurate transaction state management after a user initiates a payment using PayPal. It performs **background reconciliation**, **order status checks**, and **auto-captures payments** when required ‚Äî ensuring all PayPal transactions reach a final state of either `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`.

---

## üåê Purpose

- Processes transactions left in `PROCESSING` state.
- Recovers from missed capture calls due to network delays or unexpected errors.
- Maintains **data consistency** between PayPal and our internal DB.
- Ensures that payments are finalized reliably with **retries**, **delays**, and **fallbacks**.

## üí≥ PayPal Checkout Flow (Standard)

We are using **PayPal Standard Checkout** integration.

### 1. User Chooses PayPal Payment Option

- User selects PayPal as the payment method during checkout.

### 2. Call `createOrder` API

- Our `paypal-provider-service` sends an order creation request to PayPal using the `createOrder` API.
- A PayPal-hosted payment page URL is returned.
- **Initial PayPal order status** is: `PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED`

### 3. Customer Completes Payment on PayPal

- Customer logs in and authorizes the payment on PayPal.
- **Order status becomes `APPROVED`**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Money is not yet deducted from the customer.**

### 4. Call `captureOrder` API (Backend)

- We call `captureOrder` (from our backend) to finalize the payment.
- If successful:
  - PayPal changes the order status to `COMPLETED`
  - We mark the transaction as `SUCCESS` in our DB.

---

## üîÅ Why Reconciliation Is Needed

Sometimes the ideal flow breaks due to:

- Customer closes the PayPal tab or abandons the payment
- Network delay or timeout between `APPROVED` and `CAPTURE` API
- PayPal returns temporary errors
- Backend service crash or network error

In such cases, the transaction remains in `PROCESSING` state in our DB.

We use a **reconciliation scheduler** to recover from this.

---

## üîÑ Reconciliation Logic

A scheduled job runs every few minutes to identify and resolve transactions in `PROCESSING` status.

### Steps Involved:

1. **Fetch Processing Transactions**  
   - From our database where status = `PROCESSING`.

2. **Call PayPal `getOrder` API**  
   - Retrieve the latest status of the PayPal order.

3. **Handle Based on Order Status:**

   - **PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED**  
     The customer hasn't completed the payment.  
     We wait for a maximum of 30 minutes, retrying up to 3 times. If still not completed, mark as `FAILED`.

   - **APPROVED**  
     The customer has approved the payment, but it hasn‚Äôt been captured.  
     We call the `captureOrder` API. If successful, mark the transaction as `SUCCESS`.

   - **COMPLETED**  
     Payment was already captured (possibly by another process).  
     We mark the transaction as `SUCCESS`.

   - **Any Other Status**  
     Unexpected or error state ‚Äî we log and skip for further investigation.

## üßæ Internal Transaction Statuses (Our System)

| Status     | Meaning                                          |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| SUCCESS    | Payment completed and captured successfully      |
| PROCESSING | Awaiting payment action or capture               |
| FAILED     | Payment attempt expired, abandoned, or errored   |

---

## üì¶ PayPal Order Statuses (External)

| PayPal Status         | Meaning                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| PAYER_ACTION_REQUIRED | Waiting for customer to complete payment     |
| APPROVED              | Customer approved, but capture not done yet |
| COMPLETED             | Payment captured, money deducted             |

---

## ‚è± Retry Strategy

- Each processing transaction is retried up to **3 times** over a **30-minute window**.
- If still not completed, it is marked as `FAILED`.
- Helps avoid stuck or indefinite transactions.

---

## üß† Summary

The `paypal-processing-service` ensures reliability in our PayPal integration by handling delayed or incomplete payments through scheduled reconciliation. It makes sure no transaction is left unresolved ‚Äî leading to better consistency, user experience, and system integrity.
